**Final Quiz Score:** 90% ✅

## 🔍 Overview

This course was my first real hands-on experience building a full automation from scratch using **UiPath Studio Web**. It brought together everything I had learned in the previous modules and challenged me to think practically: from triggering workflows, managing variables, handling errors, to working across apps like email, Excel, and a browser.

---

## 📚 What I Learned

- **Studio Web Interface**: Learned to navigate panels, activities, and the workflow canvas.
- **Project Building**: Created multi-step automations with clear logic paths.
- **Data Handling**: Used inputs/outputs between activities and built expressions with Autopilot.
- **Control Flow**: Implemented conditional logic using nested If activities.
- **Error Handling**: Used breakpoints, the Watch panel, and debugging tools to identify and fix issues.
- **Cross-Platform Automation**: Worked with Microsoft 365, Google Workspace, and a simulated ACME web portal.

## 💡 Most Interesting Insight

Using **Autopilot** to generate sequences and expressions from natural language blew my mind. It’s a productivity game-changer, especially when working with unfamiliar expressions or when you’re stuck on syntax.

## 💻 Hands-On Project

I built an automation that:

1. Triggers when an email is received from a specific address
2. Downloads the invoice attachment
3. Extracts a client code
4. Logs into the ACME portal
5. Checks for available discounts
6. Applies the discount and updates the invoice
7. Sends the revised invoice back via email

It was incredibly satisfying to see it run smoothly end-to-end!

## ⚙️ Challenges Faced

There were a few bumps in the road:
- Fine-tuning the logic for handling different email cases (missing attachments, unmatched client codes)
- Setting up **target + anchor** selections in browser automation
- Debugging sequence flows when something unexpected happened mid-run

But working through these issues made me better at thinking like an automation developer.

## 🚀 Application Going Forward

- Automating internal tasks in my business using Google Sheets, Gmail, and forms
- Confidently designing automation projects end-to-end
- Applying error-handling best practices from the start instead of as an afterthought

---

## ❓Questions I Still Have

- What’s the best way to manage version control and collaboration on automation projects?
- How does Studio Web compare to Studio Desktop when scaling larger automations?
- Can we combine attended and unattended triggers in hybrid workflows?

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

This was the course where theory met execution. I didn’t just learn how automation works—I *built* one. I feel more confident now in tackling real-world use cases and can’t wait to move on to intermediate automations and explore more of what Studio Web can do.

Next stop: deeper projects and real impact!
