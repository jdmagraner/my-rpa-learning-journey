# Process Assessments

This folder contains screenshots and documentation from my first process assessment using UiPath's Process Assessment Tool.

## ðŸ§¾ Use Case: New Hire Onboarding

I evaluated an HR onboarding process for automation feasibility. The inputs were digital and structured, with no major process or application changes expected. Although the process is run quarterly, it has a high volume of steps and moderate error potential.

- **Automation Outcome:** High benefit, low effort  
- **Recommendation:** Best handled by a professional developer  
- **Time saved:** 98 man-hours/year  
- **Error reduction potential:** 98%

## ðŸ“¸ Files Included:
- Assessment screenshots (3)
- Use case document PDF

This was a valuable lesson in identifying automation opportunities before building anything in Studio.
