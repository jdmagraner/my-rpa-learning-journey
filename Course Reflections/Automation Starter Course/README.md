## 🔍 Overview

The **Automation Starter** course was my official entry into the world of Robotic Process Automation (RPA). Designed for beginners, it gave me a clear and practical foundation in everything from core automation principles to hands-on project building, prompt engineering, and agentic design. Each module built on the last, creating a well-rounded skill set that prepared me to automate real-world tasks, communicate effectively with AI, and think strategically about when—and how—to automate.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **What RPA Is**: Gained a high-level understanding of how software robots automate repetitive, rule-based tasks.
- **UiPath Studio Web**: Learned to build full automation workflows using triggers, expressions, variables, error handling, and integrations with tools like Gmail, Excel, and browsers.
- **Automation Suitability**: Evaluated processes for automation readiness using factors like stability, structure, volume, and ROI.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Developed prompt design skills to get better output from UiPath Autopilot, including the use of structure, role-based instructions, and examples.
- **Agentic Thinking**: Began exploring the concept of giving AI agents more autonomy and decision-making power through agentic automation models.

## 💡 Most Valuable Insights

- Automation isn’t just about building workflows—it’s about thinking differently. I learned to shift my mindset from “How would I do this manually?” to “What decisions and inputs does the bot need?”
- Not every process should be automated. Learning to assess stability, data structure, and error-proneness helped me avoid wasted effort.
- Clear, structured prompts are the secret to unlocking the full power of generative AI. I now approach prompt writing as a design discipline, not a guessing game.

## 💻 Projects & Exercises

- Evaluated real-world processes using UiPath's Process Assessment Tool  
- Built an end-to-end invoice update automation using Gmail, Excel, and the ACME web portal  
- Used Autopilot to write expressions, fix syntax issues, and generate summaries  
- Explored agentic workflows and the future of autonomous bots  
- Practiced prompt testing and refinement to improve AI outputs

## ⚙️ Challenges Overcome

- **Mindset Shift**: Moving from human logic to automation logic required deliberate practice and reframing.  
- **Debugging & Logic Flows**: Learning to troubleshoot and fix logic errors deepened my technical understanding.  
- **Prompt Clarity**: Writing clearly for a machine forced me to improve the way I communicate tasks.

## 🚀 How I’ll Apply This Knowledge

- Automate repetitive tasks in the solar industry using UiPath Studio Web and Google Workspace tools  
- Use prompt templates to build better, faster automations with UiPath Autopilot  
- Train coworkers in how to evaluate automation candidates and write better prompts  
- Begin exploring more advanced automation design patterns and AI agents

## ❓ Questions I'm Still Exploring

- How can I combine agentic automation with traditional RPA in hybrid workflows?
- What does good governance look like for scaling RPA in a business setting?
- How can I measure ROI across multiple bots or departments?

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

Completing the **Automation Starter** course gave me more than technical knowledge—it gave me confidence. I now understand the automation mindset, know how to build and evaluate bots, and can speak the language of AI and RPA. With this foundation in place, I’m ready to move on to more advanced concepts and build automations that make a real difference.

Next step: keep building, keep learning, and start applying these skills to real business problems!
