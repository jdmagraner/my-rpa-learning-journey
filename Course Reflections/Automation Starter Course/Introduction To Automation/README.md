## 🔍 Overview

This was my first official course in the RPA learning journey and the one that set the foundation. The *Introduction to Automation* course was designed to walk beginners through the core concepts of Robotic Process Automation (RPA), and give a high-level understanding of where and how automation can be applied.

## 📚 What I Learned

- **What RPA is**: RPA is about using software robots to automate repetitive, rule-based tasks. I learned how automation is transforming industries and improving operational efficiency.
- **Types of Robots**: Attended vs. unattended robots, and when to use each depending on the business use case.
- **Automation Suitability**: I learned how to evaluate processes based on factors like stability, structure, repetitiveness, and volume.
- **Business Value**: The course broke down how automation can deliver ROI through cost savings, productivity improvements, and error reduction.
- **UiPath Ecosystem**: This was my first exposure to UiPath Studio Web, Orchestrator, and the overall toolset that supports building, managing, and scaling automations.

## 💡 Most Interesting Insight

Learning that not every process is a good candidate for automation was eye-opening. The idea of *automation assessment* stood out to me, especially using criteria like structured data, stability, and error-prone manual tasks to determine suitability.

## 💻 Hands-On Activities

- Completed a use case evaluation using the **UiPath Process Assessment Tool**
- Analyzed an HR onboarding workflow to determine its automation potential
- Practiced identifying repetitive tasks and evaluating them for automation readiness

## ⚙️ Challenges Faced

Since this was my very first automation course, the challenge was mainly mindset: getting used to how automation *thinks*. I had to shift from manual “how I would do it” logic to “what decisions and data do the bots need?” logic.

## 🚀 Application Going Forward

I’ll be using this foundational knowledge to:

- Evaluate automation opportunities at my current job in the solar industry
- Prioritize RPA use cases using a structured assessment approach
- Build smarter bots now that I know how to ask, “Is this worth automating?”

## ❓Questions I Still Have

- How do large companies organize their RPA governance and scaling strategies?
- What are the most common mistakes people make when starting automation programs?
- How do I get better at assessing ROI?

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

Starting with this course gave me the confidence to keep going. I didn’t just learn what automation is—I learned *why* it matters, and how I can contribute real value by applying it.

On to the next one!
