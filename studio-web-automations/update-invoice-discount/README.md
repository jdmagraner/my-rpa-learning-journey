# üßæ Update Invoice with Discount Code

This automation was built as part of the Studio Web course module on data entry automation.

## üìå Use Case

When an email arrives from a specific sender, the automation:

1. Downloads the invoice attachment
2. Uploads the file to OneDrive or Google Drive
3. Extracts the client code from the spreadsheet
4. Uses a web portal (ACME System 1) to check for a matching discount
5. Inserts the discount into the invoice
6. Sends the updated invoice back via email

## üí° Key Concepts Applied

- Trigger-based automation (`Email Received`)
- File handling in Gmail, Google Drive, and OneDrive
- Excel automation: reading and writing cells
- Browser automation with `Use Browser` activity
- Anchor targeting with target + anchor configuration
- End-to-end test run with successful execution logs
