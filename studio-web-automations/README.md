# Studio Web Automations

This directory contains automation projects built using **UiPath Studio Web** as part of my RPA learning journey.

Each subfolder documents a specific automation, including:
- The purpose and use case
- Screenshots or `.ui` files
- Lessons learned or techniques practiced (e.g., variables, loops, error handling)
- GitHub links to relevant commits or project files
