## ðŸ§ª Candidate Score Email Notification Automation

This project was built as part of the "How to handle errors in Studio Web" lesson from UiPath Academy.

### ðŸ§  Use Case
An automation that reads a spreadsheet of candidate scores and sends customized email notifications based on their results:

- If the candidate was **absent**, notify them their data is unavailable.
- If the candidate **passed** (score â‰¥ 45), send a congratulations message.
- If the candidate **failed**, send an encouraging message for next time.

### ðŸ”§ Features Demonstrated
- Nested **If** logic with multiple conditions
- **Dynamic variables** pulled from spreadsheet rows
- Use of **breakpoints** to debug flow
- Monitoring variables using the **Watches panel**
- Referencing **activity documentation** from Studio Web
