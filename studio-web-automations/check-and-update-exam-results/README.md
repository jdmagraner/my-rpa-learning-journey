# ðŸ“Š Exam Results Notification Bot

This project was built as part of my RPA learning path on UiPath Academy â€” specifically for the lesson **"How to handle errors in Studio Web"**.

## ðŸ§  Use Case
The automation reads a spreadsheet of candidate names, emails, and exam scores, and sends a customized email based on the result:

â€¢ If the candidate is marked as **Absent**, send a message notifying them of no available exam data  
â€¢ If the score is **45 or higher**, send a congratulatory email  
â€¢ If the score is **below 45**, send an encouragement to try again next time

This solution demonstrates:
â€¢ Conditional logic using nested **If** activities  
â€¢ Real-time value parsing using `Double.Parse()`  
â€¢ Composing dynamic emails with variable-based personalization  
â€¢ Error handling strategies like breakpoints and watch panel usage  
â€¢ End-to-end testing of multiple outcomes via mock spreadsheet data

## ðŸ§ª Workflow Highlights
â€¢ âœ… **Manual Trigger** kicks off the process  
â€¢ âœ… **For Each Row in Spreadsheet** loops through all entries  
â€¢ âœ… **Nested If conditions** handle pass/fail/absent logic  
â€¢ âœ… **Dynamic Gmail drafts** generated with personalized subject lines and messages  
â€¢ âœ… Includes setup for Google Workspace (also available for Microsoft 365)

## ðŸ§° Files Included
â€¢ `Check and update exam results solution - Google Workspace.uip`  
â€¢ `Check and update exam results solution - Microsoft Office 365.uip`  
â€¢ Automation screenshots (in `/screenshots/`)  

## ðŸ™Œ Lessons Learned
Working with multiple branches and testing them with breakpoints helped me feel more confident troubleshooting my bots. I also practiced using the **Watch panel** to monitor key variables like `Marks` and `Email` step by step.
